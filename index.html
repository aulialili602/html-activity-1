   <h1>Current Trends in Deep Learning</h1> 
  <p>Co-written by: Eirik Folkestad, Manu Gopinathan & Ã˜yvind Nygar</p>

 <p> In the last decade, the area of artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded with interesting and promising results. With major achievements in image recognition, <br>speech recognition and highly complex games, AI continues to disrupt society. This blog post will discuss practical applications of AI,</br> optimization and interpretability of deep learning models and reinforcement learning (RL), based on the 2018 REWORK Deep Learning Summit in Toronto. Four software engineers from Knowit had the pleasure of travelling to Canada to attend this conference, and with renowned speakers such as Geoff Hinton attending, it turned out be an insightful experience.</p>

<h2>Practical Predictions and Applications of AI</h2>

<p>Early AI revolved around perceiving, deciding and acting. Today, the addition of learning is also in place, but due to the non-deterministic nature of the real world, decisions cannot be made purely from the facts that are given.<br> Further development of AI will require improvements in a variety of areas. Andrew W. Moore, Dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, shared his thoughts on what he thinks will be important.</br>
