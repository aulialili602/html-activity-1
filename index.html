   <h1>Current Trends in Deep Learning</h1> 
  <p>Co-written by: Eirik Folkestad, Manu Gopinathan & Ã˜yvind Nygard</p>

 <p> In the last decade, the area of artificial intelligence (AI) has exploded with interesting and promising results. With major achievements in image recognition, <br>speech recognition and highly complex games, AI continues to disrupt society. This blog post will discuss practical applications of AI,</br> optimization and interpretability of deep learning models and reinforcement learning (RL), based on the 2018 REWORK Deep Learning Summit in Toronto. Four software engineers from Knowit had the pleasure of travelling to Canada to attend this conference, and with renowned speakers such as Geoff Hinton attending, it turned out be an insightful experience.</p>

<h2>Practical Predictions and Applications of AI</h2>

<p>Early AI revolved around perceiving, deciding and acting. Today, the addition of learning is also in place, but due to the non-deterministic nature of the real world, decisions cannot be made purely from the facts that are given.<br> Further development of AI will require improvements in a variety of areas. Andrew W. Moore, Dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon, shared his thoughts on what he thinks will be important.</br>
</p>

<p>Firstly, game theory provides an improvement to the decision making capabilities of an AI model, as the most probable answer is not always the correct answer. This can be explained from his example of an AI trying to predict the whereabouts of poachers in a national park. <br>At first, the AI performed well at predicting the location of poachers, however, after a while the poachers in the national park learned from this and went to less obvious locations. As a result of this, the AI degenerated in performance<//br> To improve the AI, game theory was introduced. By viewing the poachers as other players in a game, the AI was able to predict where the poachers were located even though they were not necessarily located at the optimal locations.
